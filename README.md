# Mocking temperature sensor data generator

This project generates synthetic sensor readings of geolocated temperature data, and post each record to a `Kafka` topic. The readings generated follow the format specified in the sample records below:

```
{"timestamp": 1585054952527, "geohash": "u155mz82dv33", "sensorId":"s000001", "temp_val": 20.3, "temp_unit": "c"} 
{"timestamp": 1585080280353, "geohash": "u155krxynu5s", "sensorId":"s000002", "temp_val": 19.7, "temp_unit": "c"}
{"timestamp": 1585080335267, "geohash": "u155mz827m6q", "sensorId":"s000010", "temp_val": 24.6, "temp_unit": "c"}
{"timestamp": 1585080366564, "geohash": "u155krxynuhu", "sensorId":"s000007", "temp_val": 17.2, "temp_unit": "c"}
{"timestamp": 1585080388268, "geohash": "u155mz827v2n", "sensorId":"s000004", "temp_val": 22.2, "temp_unit": "c"}
```

## Usage

At least one running instance of `Kafka` and `Zookeeper` are required for the generator script to run. Optionally, we provide a `docker-compose` file for deploying a testing `Kafka` environment in your local machine. To use it, run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-kafka.yml up -d
```

Once this environment is up, you can spawn the Docker container where the generator script is going to run, and optionally specifying some environment variables, such as the bounding box (`BBOX`) within which the temperature readings are going to be located (as a comma-separated sequence of coordinates: `<north>,<west>,<south>,<easth>`), as well as the minimum (`MIN_TEMP`) and maximum (`MAX_TEMP`) values the temperature readings can take (in Celsius degrees):

```
docker run -it \
    --network="host" \
    -e KAFKA_BROKER="localhost:9092" \
    -e BBOX="51.32288838086245,4.091720581054688,51.1509246836981,4.752960205078125" \
    -e MAX_TEMP=50.0 \
    -e MIN_TEMP=5.0 \
    -e KAFKA_TOPIC="temperature-readings" \
    -e RND_SEED="0.0" \
    temp-readings-gen
```

In case you already have a running `Kafka` setup, omit the `--network="host"` argument, and set the correspondent url (or urls) to the `KAFKA_BROKER` environment variable.

Now you should be able to consume the readings from the `temperature-readings` topic by accessing the `Kafka` Docker container (or by `ssh` into the broker of your existing `Kafka` setup) and running the following command:

```
kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic temperature-readings \
    --from-beginning \
    --formatter kafka.tools.DefaultMessageFormatter \
    --property print.value=true \
    --property key.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer \
    --property value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```
